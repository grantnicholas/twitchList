twitchList
==========

A quick python script to grab the top live dota2 streams, display the streams in order of most views to least 
views, ask the user which stream they want to watch, and then open the stream from the terminal using
livestreamer. 

Just run python twitchlist.py


For the future:
1.Make the script have optional inputs to specify what game to search for [ie dota2 vs sc2]
2.Make the streams be sorted by LIVE viewers and not total views 


DEPENDENCY WARNING: livestreamer @ http://livestreamer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html
